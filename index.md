excerpt: "A research project investigating balancing national security and economic interests in foreign investment"
---

We aim to identify the nature, extent and causes of the growing divergence between countriesâ€™ policies on inward foreign investment and their increasing links to national security.  Our collaboration combines insights from political science, economics and law to shed light on the economic implications of these policy shifts, their consistency with international trade law and international investment law, and their role in the current geopolitical landscape. We gratefully acknowledge funding from the _**Australian Research Council**_.
